Application Name
Overview
This application is a full-stack solution built with ASP.NET Core, incorporating Razor Pages for the frontend and a RESTful API for the backend. It's designed to demonstrate a tax calculation system based on various criteria.

Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK (Version: specify_version_here)
SQL Server (or another compatible database system)
A suitable IDE (like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider)
Getting Started
To run this application on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository_url_here]
2. Change the Connection String
Before running the application, you need to update the connection string to match your local database credentials. This step is crucial for the application to connect to your SQL Server and create the necessary database.

Open the appsettings.json file in the root directory of the project.
Locate the ConnectionStrings section.
Replace the DefaultConnection value with your local database connection details.
Example:

json
Copy code
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_database;User Id=your_username;Password=your_password;"
}
3. Build and Run the Application
Navigate to the project directory and execute the following commands:

bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
These commands will restore any NuGet packages, build the project, and run the application.

4. Accessing the Application
Once the application is running, you can access the Razor Pages frontend via your web browser at http://localhost:5000 (or the port specified by your application).

5. Database Initialization
On the first run, the application will automatically create and configure the database as per the defined models and context.

Additional Information
For further customization or development, refer to the source code documentation and comments.
Ensure that your SQL Server instance is running and accessible.
